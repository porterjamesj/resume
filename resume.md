## Experience

- **Software Engineer**, 2014-present

    *Center for Data Intensive Science* — Chicago, Illinois

    - Migrated almost 2 PB of genomic data from a legacy storage
      system into various S3-like backends.
    - Imported and harmonized metadata from poorly organized
      tab-delimited text files into a PostgreSQL / Elasticsearch backend.
    - Developed HTTP APIs for accessing genomic data and metadata.

- **Software Engineering Intern**, 2014

    *Stripe* — San Francisco, California

    - Developed internal tooling for large scale correctness and
      performance testing of financial operations code.
    - Refactored legacy code to improve testability.

- **Student Research Programmer**, 2013-2014

    *Laboratory for Advanced Computing* — Chicago, Illinois
