    - Imported and harmonized metadata from poorly organized legacy
      systems into PostgreSQL / Elasticsearch.
    - Developed HTTP APIs and backend services for accessing genomic
      data and metadata.
    - Developed and maintained configuration for operational aspects
      of the system, including deployment, service discovery, etc.
