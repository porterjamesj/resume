**Software Engineer**, November 2014 - November 2015

  *University of Chicago [Center for Translational Data Science](http://ctds.uchicago.edu/)* â€” Chicago, Illinois

  - Helped build the National Cancer Institute's [Genomic Data
    Commons](https://gdc.cancer.gov), a system for storing and
    organizing cancer genomics data for the clinical research
    community.
  - Built and operated a fault-tolerant distributed work scheduler for
    re-processing over two petabytes of genomic sequence data with a
    modern bioinformatics pipeline, using Python, Docker, and
    Consul. The system used 40k cores distributed over ~1000 machines
    at its peak, and enabled to us to meet a tight, crucial deadline
    and launch the GDC on time.
  - Built the core HTTP API that enabled users to access the system,
    as well as ETL processes for continuously syncing metadata from
    multiple sets of manually managed, poorly organized CSV and Excel
    files, doing entity resolution, and storing the resulting
    normalized records in Postgres and Elasticsearch.
  - Built and maintained custom deployment, operations, and monitoring
    tooling using Python, Consul, Nginx, and Openstack.
