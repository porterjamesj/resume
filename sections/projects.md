## Projects

- I use [Ansible to configure my personal computing
  infrastructure](https://github.com/porterjamesj/config) (laptop,
  VPS, home server, etc.).
- I'm the author and maintainer of
  [Gumbo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/Gumbo.jl), the HTML parsing
  package for the [Julia programming
  language](https://julialang.org). I was also one of the primary
  organizers of the first [Julia conference](https://juliacon.org) in 2014.
- I wrote
  [virtualenvwrapper.el](https://github.com/porterjamesj/virtualenvwrapper.el),
  an Emacs package for managing Python virtual environments.
