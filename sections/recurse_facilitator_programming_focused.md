  [*Recurse Center*](https://www.recurse.com) — New York, New York

  - The Recurse Center ("RC") is a free, self-directed educational
    retreat for programmers with an integrated recruiting agency. I
    worked on running and improving all aspects of RC's business and
    community, including building software, infrastructure work,
    data analysis, business strategy, writing, community management, and
    more. My technical work at RC primarily used Ruby, Rails,
    PostgreSQL, JavaScript (including React and Redux), and
    occasionally Python for data-focused projects.
  - With a colleague, I built [RC
    Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv801wYJoXQ), a
    real-time, virtual space used to host the retreat online in 2020
    and beyond. Features include a 2D world with real-time movement
    and editing, text and audio chat, Zoom syncing, multi-tenancy, a
    user-facing API, and more. This enabled RC to survive the
    pandemic, and many attendees described it as the best remote
    experience they'd had from any job or educational institution.
  - Though years of iterative changes and new features, I dramatically
    improved RC's internal recruiting software, making the recruiting
    team more efficient and ultimately improving revenue.
    - Built a new search tool that ingested and indexed all of RC's
      internal data on candidates, speeding up the process of finding
      and validating potential matches for roles at client companies.
    - I added new data modeling capabilities that enabled granular
      tracking of job search progress. I then built data pipelines and
      warehouses that enabled analyzing this data to answer important
      business questions (e.g. "what will our revenue be like three
      months from now?") for the first time.
    - Fixed many time-wasting bugs, including tricky data consistency
      and concurrency issues.
  - I built lots of other software, including data pipelines for RC's
    admissions system, software for matching retreat attendees at
    random for daily "coffee chats", automating the retreat onboarding
    process and communications, new channels for attendees to give
    feedback about the retreat, improved tools for onboarding and
    managing client companies, and more.
  - I also did lots of meaningful non-programming work at RC,
    including leading the hiring and onboarding process for several
    new hires, developing and putting into practice [principles for
    self-directed education](https://recurse.com/self-directives),
    advocating successfully for a transformative mindset shift in our
    recruiting business, helping run RC's annual alumni reunion, and
    planning and launching experiments like [mini
    retreats](https://www.recurse.com/blog/127-a-new-way-to-join-the-rc-community),
    the [*Still Computing*
    newsletter](https://www.recurse.com/still-computing), an
    [educational compute cluster for the RC
    community](https://www.recurse.com/blog/126-heap-sponsors-rc-community-cluster),
    and many more.
