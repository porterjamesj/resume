**Independent Technical Consultant / Sabbatical** (June 2023 - present)

- Ongoing software development for the Recurse Center on a part-time,
  contract basis, while taking some time for personal goals, including
  a [thru-hike of Vermont's Long
  Trail](https://www.jamesporter.me/hiking/lt23/) and a 700 mile-long
  hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.
- My work during this time includes improving performance of a core
  internal recruiting tool using predictive data pre-fetching, adding
  new search features (e.g. more data sources, support for multiple
  locations), saving money and simplifying code by removing
  integrations with now-unused third-party services, many bugfixes,
  and important ongoing infrastructure work (e.g. keeping up with
  database and framework upgrades to prevent security issues).
