    - [RC](https://www.recurse.com) is a free, self-directed
      educational retreat for programmers with an integrated
      recruiting agency. I work on running and improving all aspects
      of our business and community. My work includes programming,
      writing, community and space management, event planning,
      advertising, data analysis, and more.
    - Dramatically improved our system for getting our candidates mock
      interviews, which is crucial to their success in getting hired,
      and therefore our revenue. Transitioned from an entirely
      manual process with two staff members giving mock interviews to
      a largely automated process that coordinates a group of over 40
      volunteers from our community, and can support a much higher
      volume of candidates with much less work.
    - Designed, procured, built, and operated an [educational server
      cluster for the RC
      community](https://www.recurse.com/blog/126-heap-sponsors-rc-community-cluster),
      including configuration management with Ansible, and building
      tools for syncing user accounts and permissions with our primary
      database.
    - Fixed bugs and added new features to our internal software using
      Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript
        - Dramatically improved the performance of syncing between our
          internal task management system and Asana by moving it to a
          job queue, while fixing a years-old race condition that
          caused task edits to be silently discarded.
        - Added support for gender pronouns to our community directory
          and chat system.
