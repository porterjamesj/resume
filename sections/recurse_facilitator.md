- **Facilitator** (March 2016 - Sept 2021) → **Senior Facilitator** (Sept 2021 - May 2023)

    [*Recurse Center*](https://www.recurse.com) — New York, New York

    - [RC](https://www.recurse.com) is a free, self-directed
      educational retreat for programmers with an integrated
      recruiting agency. I worked on running and improving all aspects
      of RC's business and community. My work included programming,
      writing, community and space management, advising and
      mentorship, business strategy, event planning, advertising, data
      analysis, and more.
    - When I first joined RC in early 2016, my role focused on giving
      individualized advice and support to Recursers. I helped them
      figure out their learning goals, plan their batch, decide what
      projects would be best for them, and pair programmed with
      them. I worked on a huge variety of projects and languages. I
      also helped plan and run events, including end-of-batch parties
      and job fairs (which were crucial to our recruiting revenue).
    - Throughout my time at RC, I also did a lot of day-to-day,
      month-to-month, maintenance work to keep RC running. Things like
      planning and organizing the first day each batch, reviewing
      applications to RC, moderating Zulip (RC's shared chat server,
      like Slack), tidying the space, helping Recursers plan and run
      their ideas for events (panels, etc.), hosting weekly
      end-of-week presentations, hosting bigger events like
      end-of-batch parties and job fairs, writing and sending The
      Loop, RC's monthly newsletter, noticing social problems crop up
      and nipping them in the bud (e.g. by giving difficult Recursers
      feedback about their behavior), paying attention to the vibes
      during the batch and trying to shift it, checking in with
      Recursers who aren't participating to ask them what's up,
      noticing when Recursers seemed to be looking for jobs and
      alerting the recruiting team, organizing daily checkins (kind of
      like a standup for Recursers), transcribing live talks for Deaf
      Recursers, ordering supplies and furniture for the space.
    - In early 2017, my role changed to focus less on providing
      individual support to Recursers, and more on making structural
      changes to improve the retreat as a whole entity. We recognized
      that the individual support role facilitators had been playing
      was better done by *other Recursers*, and the efforts of
      faculty, who could see the whole picture, would be better spent
      focusing on it. Things I did during this period include:
      - Dramatically improved our system for getting candidates mock
        interviews, which is crucial to their success in getting hired,
        and therefore our revenue. Transitioned from an entirely
        manual process with two staff members giving mock interviews to
        a largely automated process that coordinates a group of over 40
        volunteers from our community, and can support a much higher
        volume of candidates with much less work.
      - Revamped and streamlined how we run the first day of a batch
        (I did this several more times over the years). I also made
        other efforts to streamline onboarding new Recursers,
        including a buddy system, "RC Gateway", that matched incoming
        Recursers with alums who shared their background or interests
        for an introductory chat and to ask questions.
      - Contributed writing to a total redesign of RC's public facing website
      - Resolved many trial-by-fire community management issues,
        including but not limited to: conflicts over lighting and
        noise in the RC space, multiple sexual harassment and assault
        complaints. Some of these were very contentious and painful,
        and sometimes culminated in removing people from the
        community, although we tried to avoid that were possible. At
        all times I tried to balance my responsibility to do right by
        the individuals involved with my responsibility to the
        community of which I was a steward.
      - I also thought of and implemented creative solutions to some
        of these problems. For example "Noise Bot", which anyone could
        use to anonymously ping everyone in the space on Zulip when it
        was getting too loud and ask them to shush. This was
        shockingly effective, and remained popular and well-used until
        we moved to a larger space where it wasn't necessary.
      - Improved RC's physical space by working with Recursers to add
        dedicated stations for pair programming. These proved wildly
        popular and persist at RC as of 2024.
      - Worked on various projects attempting to grow more of a
        culture of critical feedback at RC, none of which really
        succeeded. The thinking was that RC is very good at being
        supportive, sometimes to a fault. Critical feedback helps
        people grow and it was hard to get it. The most successful of
        these were "crit groups", modeled after the concept from art
        school. They never really stuck though.
      - Helped plan and run [Never Graduate
        Week](https://www.recurse.com/ngw-2017), RC's annual alumni
        reunion. I would help with this every year for the rest of the
        time I worked at RC. This involved setting up the website with
        info and for people to RSVP, helping rent and manage an
        external overflow space (our space wasn't big enough at the
        time), organizing official panels, talks, and Q&As, as well as
        helping with the A/V setup for livestreaming some of them, and
        helping Recursers host their own.
      - Helped plan and launch [mini
        retreats](https://www.recurse.com/blog/127-a-new-way-to-join-the-rc-community),
        which enabled people to join the community by attending RC for
        only a week (previously, you had to come for at least six
        weeks). These grew out of thinking about how to engage alums
        more effectively, as well as how to allow people who might not
        otherwise be able to come (parents, people with full-time
        jobs) to join the community.
      - Co-led, with Nick, RC's CEO, the hiring a new Facilitator
        after a colleague left the company. This included designing
        the actual interviews, choosing tools to stay organized and
        get back to candidates in a timely fashion, and executing on
        everything. I would go on to lead most of RC's hiring while I
        worked there. I led hiring processes for two facilitators
        (Mai, Liz) and three career facilitators (Sydney, Selomé,
        Laura), almost all of whom turned out to be excellent hires,
        staying at the company for multiple years, and making
        countless contributions to RC's success. Candidates who went
        through the hiring processes I designed consistently described
        them as the best interview experience they've ever had,
        praising our thoughtfulness, directness, transparency, and
        consistency. I also helped or led onboarding for all of these
        people plus Alicia.
      - Designed, procured, built, and operated an [educational server
        cluster for the RC
        community](https://www.recurse.com/blog/126-heap-sponsors-rc-community-cluster),
        including configuration management with Ansible, and building
        tools for syncing user accounts and permissions with our primary
        database.
    - In March 2018, my colleague who was primarily responsible for running RC's recruiting business (the part of the company that actually makes money) left on short notice, and I stepped up to fill the gap. For the rest of my time at RC, my work would also include thinking about, improving, and executing the day-to-day tasks of our recruiting business. I primarily focused on the Recurser-facing aspects of recruiting, since these overlapped with my primarily responsibilities, but I also did some work on the partner company-facing side. Things I did include:
      - Reviewing Recursers resumes. I honed my advice and delivery of it over many years of practice, and through looking at hundreds of resumes. Recursers described my guidance as "a revelation".
      - Writing referrals (short "cover letters" that we sent to
        partner companies on behalf of a Recurser, explaining why we
        think the Recurser would be a great fit for the role)
      - Managing day-to-day communications with Recursers about their job searches: giving advice, assuaging their fears, answering their questions about everything from basic email etiquette, to negotiation, to juggling multiple interview processes.
      - Developing and honing strategies for bringing on new partner companies
      - Leading the hiring process for a new "Career Facilitator"
        (what we would come to call the person who focuses on
        recruiting). See above section about hiring.
      - Made many small, iterative software changes to our admin tool
        for managing Recursers job searches and our communication with
        them ("Jobs Chat") using Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, that
        helped us work more efficiently and automate tedious work. These include:
          - Make the software rename uploaded resumes consistently based on the Recursers' name (no more "Resume Final (2).pdf")
          - Over the years, fix many small, hard to track down bugs
            that collectively wasted a lot of our time and energy. For
            example, I eventually tracked down and fixed a bug that
            made it look like a Recurser had sent us messages when
            they hadn't, which had dogged us for years at that point.
          - Added many quality of life improvements, e.g. allowing
            easy editing of company names and logos.
          - Dramatically improved the performance of syncing between
            our internal task management system and Asana by moving it
            to a job queue, while fixing a years-old race condition that
            caused task edits to be silently discarded. This save us
            time in an important daily meeting that had about half the
            company in it.
          - Add automatic tasks for e.g. checking in with someone to
            ask how a new job is going after they start it, or wish
            them good luck on an interview
          - Change the way we represent Recursers' experience to allow
            for more nuance (it used to be "Senior", "Intermediate", etc.
            and I made it an actual number of years)
      - Over the course of years, I improved our ability to collect and
        analyze data about our business.
        - I added new data modeling capabilities and user-facing features to Jobs Chat that let us carefully track Recursers' progress through their job searches and interview processes.
        - I built data pipelines and warehouses using SQL and
          proprietary tools that let us denormalize the dats to quickly
          make graphs and answer questions about this data. For
          example "What proportion of our revenue comes from returning
          alums vs new Recurser placements? How has that changed over
          time?" for the first time. Many of these insights proved
          transformative for our business. To take the previous
          example, we realized that alum placements account for a much
          larger proportion of our revenue than we'd expected, and
          that keeping alums engaging so we could help their job
          searches was not a nice-to-have, but rather critical.
        - I also helped build a predictive model of RC's future
          revenue.
        - I later built similar pipelines of data about admissions and
          applications to RC, to help answer similar questions about
          community growth.
    - In early 2019, our business was struggling, and we focused even
        more heavily on recruiting. As part of our efforts to fix
        this, I argued for and successful a convinced us to adopt an
        important mindset shift in how we approached recruiting. In
        the past we'd been very short-term results-oriented: giving a
        lot of individual attention to Recursers who were about to
        sign an offer to help them sign with one of our partner
        companies, sweating the last few days of a month to get our
        revenue up higher, etc. I argued that at this point in
        someone's interview process, there's relatively little we can
        do to change the outcome, and we'd do better to focus our time
        and energy on a more "upstream" point in our funnel where we
        have more leverage, specifically: sending referrals. Using the
        data pipeline I'd built previously, we could answer questions
        like: "on average, how much money do we make from sending a
        single referral?". That tells us how many referrals we need to
        send to hit certain financial milestones, and then we can do
        work to focus on increasing those numbers. This was
        successful, on many axes. It led to further fruitful work
        (e.g. developing a software / process to ensure we reached out
        to every RC alum about their job situation every three
        months), cultural changes to how we though about our business,
        and ultimately increased revenue.
    - I also did quite a bit of work on what we called "community
      growth": getting more and a more diverse set of people to
      apply to RC. This ranged from direct outreach inviting people
      to apply, to designing and executing invitiatives to get the
      RC community to spread the word more, to running and analyzing
      ad campaigns on social media.
      - Helped launch and source content for [Joy of
        Computing](https://joy.recurse.com/), a link aggregator we
        built to showcase Recursers' work and advertise RC to
        potential applicants.
      - Helpe launch, edit, and layout issues of [Still
        Computing](https://www.recurse.com/still-computing), an "email
        newsletter for curious programmers, largely written by members
        of the Recurse Center community".
      - Helped spread the word in the community about RC Scout, an "ad
        network / webring" that Recursers installed on their personal
        websites and blogs to direct traffic to RC.
      - Helped develop the idea for and launch
        [Fellowships](https://www.recurse.com/blog/145-fellowships-for-women-working-on-open-source-programming-projects-research-and-art),
        where we paid people from groups underrepresented in
        programming $10,000 to come to RC and work on ambitious
        projects.
    - Helped distill our ad-hoc, unwritten policies for dealing with
      "bad behavior" by Recursers (everything from being generally
      unpleasant, up to sexual assault) into a [Code of Conduct for
      RC](https://recurse.com/code-of-conduct). I contributed to the
      overall policies and procedures, writing, and implementation
      (for example, setting up an anonymous comment box for Recursers
      to make reports). The CoC dramatically streamlined our process
      for dealing with difficult situations, and made it easier for us
      and Recursers to know what to do when something bad happened.
    - In March 2020, RC, like most of the world, had to completely
      change because of the pandemic. I contributed to and led many
      aspects of our response, from our initial communications as the
      pandemic first swept New York, and continuing through the long
      process of adapting RC to a changed world.
      - Built [RC Together](https://www.rctogether.com/), a real-time,
        virtual space that syncs with Zoom, which we used to host the
        retreat online. I built the very first version, which was
        simply a page on our website with a map of our space where
        clicking on a room would take you to a corresponding Zoom
        meeting. With a colleague, I iterated on it over the next
        almost two years, until it was a rich online space that
        genuinely made you feel more connected to the people you
        shared it with. It featured real-time movement and editing,
        audio chats, Zoom syncing, and more. Many Recursers described
        it as the best remote experience they'd had from any job or
        educational institution. When we were trying to sell RC
        Together to other companies as a potential new revenue stream,
        I also produced and edited a short [demo
        video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv801wYJoXQ) explaining
        it.
      - I made lots of other software changes to accommodate an online
        world:
          - Built system to match Recursers with each other at random
            each day for "coffee chats".
          -
      - I iteratively tweaked the structure and social norms of the
        retreat to work better in a remote world, trying to answer
        hard questions like: "How do you facilitate serendipitious
        conversations online, like those happen around the coffee
        machine in real life?".
          - This included figuring out which of RC's typical events
            (presentations, game nights, batch transition) worked
            online and which didn't, coming up with replacements for
            those that didn't, and tweaking those that did.
          - Helped plan moving Never Graduate Week online, which
            included making Zoom and Virtual RC work for events with
            hundreds of participants.
